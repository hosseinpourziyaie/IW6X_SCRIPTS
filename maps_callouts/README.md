# Call of DutyÂ®: Ghosts Map Location Callout Display HUD 

## Installation 
Just copy script folder in "game directory\iw6x\scripts" then 
It will load automatically for private match and dedicated server

## How it Works?

Ill add simple explanation for this section later. Im just too tired right now

## Notes

It took about 12h (8h for base script + 4h for map data for maps fog and dynasty) of my time to write this script :(
