# Call of DutyÂ®: Ghosts Scripted Cinematic Flight Travel

## Installation 
This script requires **[iw6x-client](https://github.com/XLabsProject/iw6x-client)**. get lastest release of it from [here](https://github.com/XLabsProject/iw6x-client/releases/latest)

Just copy script folder in "game directory\iw6x\scripts" then start private match/run dedicated server. it loads automatically.

## How it Works?
- It spawns script_model then it links player to that entity. it starts moving camera in pathz instructed in flight script 

## Notes
- for Recording Travel Pathz you can use dev tool that I have added in end of script(commented out by default)
- Aside from Initial Release that i spent some days working on it, It took sometime about 18~24 hours for updating it to revision2. respect the work
