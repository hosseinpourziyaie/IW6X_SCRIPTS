# Call of DutyÂ®: Ghosts Scripted Cinematic Flight Travel

## Installation 
Just copy script folder in "game directory\iw6x\scripts" then 
It will load automatically for private match and dedicated server

## How it Works?

- It spawns script_model then it links player to that entity. it starts moving camera in pathz instructed in flight script 

## Notes

- for Recording Travel Pathz you can use dev tool that I have added in end of script(commented out by default)


## TODO

- Add User-Handler start button
- Add Bezier Flight feature
- Record flight scripts for other maps
